# Using LLMs in Generating Design Rationale for Software Architecture Decisions

This repository contains the experiment results of the paper *"Using LLMs in Generating Design Rationale for Software Architecture Decisions"*, as well as the implementation code for the LLM-based agents presented in the paper. The dataset and code are provided to help other researchers and developers replicate the experiments or conduct further research.

## Directory Structure
- `Code/`: contains the implementation code of the LLM-based agents.
- `Pilot_Results/` provides the results of the pilot experiments for data labeling, accuracy metrics, and manual assessment.
- `Results/`: provides the experiment results of the three prompting strategies.
- `Collected_Data.xlsx` provides the data used in this study.
